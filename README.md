# Lisa Lemons makes a Wordpress Theme

You heard it here first!

I have always wanted to turn my existing website into a Wordpress theme. Originally, the website was built only on HTML and CSS. Now it's time to place the site ontop of my favorite CMS.

I've been using Wordpress to build people's websites for years now. I'm excited to do the same for myself.
